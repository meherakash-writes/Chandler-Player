# Chandler-Player
Watching Friends(TV series) will never be same anymore. There will be void .... always.

We cannot thank Matthew Perry enough for giving us the wonderful character called Chandler Bing! 
‘Awesome’ does not even begin to describe how incredible Chandler is. 
What makes him stand out is his wit and sarcasm.

We all(viewers) have practically lived the characters through the years.

I am sure you must be urging to re-watch the series once again - To visit his
signature smile, quizzical dance, no holds barred humour and the unoffending laughter once again.

Why not use FRIENDS themed video player this time - Chandler Player(Extermely appologies for shamelessly copying the name but i couldn't help myself)
A small player made with love as a tribute to Matthew Perry. To watch him only and his relatable one line quotes-
"I'm not great at advice... Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?" 
“Hi, I’m Chandler. I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.”
Oh, yeah, I’m a gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last… twelve hundred times.”
“Hey I can handle anything, handle is my middle name! …Well actually it’s the middle part of my first name.”
"I say more dumb things before 9 AM than most people say all day."...

You are most welcome to hit my github repositry if you want to try this python based player. 
Trick to play the video is to Click Button named "I'll  Be  There  For You" to browse your media files.
Functionality to play,pause,stop,foward and rewind the media is present.

Hey Perry-Thanks introducing us to world of humour and Sarcasm. 
Chandler Bing, you will be deeply missed!
